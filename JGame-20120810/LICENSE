What this means in practice.

BSD is one of the most permissive open source licenses.  It allows you to
distribute commercial products based on the software.  It has one restriction
though, which is that the distributions refer back to the original license
file (or the original project as far as I'm concerned).  So, putting "Made
with JGame" in the in-app about text is enough to meet the license
requirements.  I consider leaving the "JGame" text visible in the load screen
also sufficient.

As regards the games, you are welcome to adapt them but I expect a clear
reference to the original game.  Some of the content is not by me, but this
should be all "creative commons attribution" licensed material.  This means
you are free to use them but you should retain the credits as found in the
games.
